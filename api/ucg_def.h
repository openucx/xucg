/**
 * @ingroup UCG_CONTEXT
 * @brief UCG Application Context
 *
 * UCG application context (or just a context) is an opaque handle that holds a
 * UCG communication instance's global information.  It represents a single UCG
 * communication instance.  The communication instance could be an OS process
 * (an application) that uses UCP library.  This global information includes
 * communication resources, endpoints, memory, temporary file storage, and
 * other communication information directly associated with a specific UCG
 * instance.  The context also acts as an isolation mechanism, allowing
 * resources associated with the context to manage multiple concurrent
 * communication instances. For example, users using both MPI and OpenSHMEM
 * sessions simultaneously can isolate their communication by allocating and
 * using separate contexts for each of them. Alternatively, users can share the
 * communication resources (memory, network resource context, etc.) between
 * them by using the same application context. A message sent or a RMA
 * operation performed in one application context cannot be received in any
 * other application context.

  * necessary information to perform collectives, so re-starting an operation

 * in different groups, identifiers which are passed by user during creation.
